# DataKit

An easy to use CoreData wrapper in Swift.

## Requirements

DataKit requires Swift 2.1 and Xcode 7.2.

## Installation

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate NetKit into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "azizuysal/DataKit"
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `DataKit.framework` into your Xcode project.

### CocoaPods

Not supported.

### Manually

You can integrate NetKit manually into your project simply by dragging `DataKit.framework` onto Linked Frameworks and Libraries section in Xcode.

## Usage
